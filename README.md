# DataScience-2015 Readme
####Our team consisted of Hong Ding, Philipp Dumitrescu and Herman Leung. Under the mentorship of Hossein Falaki from Databricks, we devoted three weeks during the summer of 2015 working on the "Acronyms" project. In particular, we developed tools for analyzing the acronyms we scraped and extracted from AcronymFinder.com and Wikipedia.
