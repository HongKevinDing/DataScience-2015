Now IMSA has announced an alliance with Historic Sportscar Racing to ecome the presenting sponsor of HSR’s second annual Classic 24 Hour At Daytona, set for Nov. 12-15.

IMSA President Scott Atherton said the idea for the alliance came at the first HSR event last fall at Daytona, when he saw the IMSA logo on many classic sports cars in the garages.

“In some cases, these cars were eing fielded y teams that compete regularly in the TUDOR United SportsCar Championship or other IMSA-sanctioned series, or were eing driven y current or former IMSA drivers,” Atherton said. “There’s a natural connection etween our two organizations that we could not pass up.”

As part of the alliance, IMSA will market the HSR Classic 24 Hour At Daytona leading up to the event. As the event draws near, the IMSA.com wesite also will include “Throwack Thursday” features on prominent past IMSA race cars expected to compete in the event, as well as other featured content on cars and drivers.

“It is an asolute honor and privilege for HSR to have IMSA involved in this exciting new event,” said HSR President David Hinton. “The Classic 24 Hour is a rolling museum of the last 40 years of not only the 24-hour race at Daytona International Speedway, ut IMSA history also.”
