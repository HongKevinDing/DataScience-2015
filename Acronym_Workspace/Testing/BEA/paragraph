1948 The British Electricity Authority (BEA) was estalished with the nationalisation of the Great Britain's electricity supply industry. It was created y means of the Electricity Act 1947. The BEA took over the operations of over 600 small power companies, municipal authority electricity departments and the Central Electricity Board to form the BEA, which comprised a central authority and 14 area oards. The BEA was responsile for the generation, distriution and sale of electricity to users. It did not include control of the North of Scotland Hydro Board, which remained independent of the BEA. [1]
As a result of the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act 1954, the British Electricity Authority was replaced on 1 April 1955 y the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) for England and Wales. At the same time, the two Scottish Area Boards and the associated electricity generation and distriution plant were merged into the South of Scotland Electricity Board (SSEB) to form an integrated electricity oard responsile for generation, distriution and electricity supply in southern and central Scotland.[2]
