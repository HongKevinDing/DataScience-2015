Jack Austin caught four passes for 76 yards with one TD, Raymond Hudson caught four passes for 35 yards, and Trevor Davis had two receptions for 44 yards for the Golden Bears. Bryce Treggs was on the receiving end of Goff’s three-yard scoring throw on the second drive for the first-team offense, while Austin picked up an eight-yard scoring catch from Forrest during the team’s red zone work late in the first half.We tried to make it as fan-friendly as possible but the important thing is to get work done and take care of our players, and I thought we accomplished that,” head coach Sonny Dykes said in a news release. “I thought we certainly accomplished our goals. We stayed healthy (and) we got things on tape that we can improve on. From that standpoint I thought it was a really good day. I think people who came enjoyed it.
