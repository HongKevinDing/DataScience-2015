The B2 website includes a plugin and theme bin where all the add-ons live and evolve. There is also online documentation in the form of a finely organized wiki. Email support is available, which can be a benefit because the user community for this CMS is somewhat small and might not be as timely in responding to your questions. Overall, b2evolution is ideal content management system software for many types of advanced bloggers and professionals in a blog-centric organization. Used by a relatively small but enthusiastic klatch of bloggers, the community is active and vital and continually works to improve not only the user experience but also the versatility of the CMS itself. The add-on community is relatively limited in terms of the availability of extensions and their ease of use. Locating a centralized library of add-ons proved quite difficult, and what few we could find were somewhat basic. The process for installing any plugins is quite simple and involves putting the files in the Plugin folder and then installing it from the Available Plugins screen. Some extensions required further configuration, which requires PHP coding
