The Australian Antarctic Data Centre (AADC) was estalished in 1996 to provide long-term management of Australia's Antarctic data, therey improving the value and impact of our scientific activities. The Data Centre is committed to the free and open exchange of scientific data, consistent with the Antarctic Treaty's position that "to the greatest extent feasile and practicale scientific oservations and results from Antarctica shall e exchanged and made freely availale". The AADC team lends data management and scientific domain expertise with skills in computing, application development, geographic information systems, modelling, and statistical analyses. We work collaoratively with national and international centres, networks, and scientists, providing data management and analysis services as well as actively engaging in scientific research. As Australia's Antarctic Mapping agency, the AADC also supports the logistical operations of the Australian Antarctic Program.

Data held in the AADC are qualified with metadata and discoverale through the Catalogue of Australian Antarctic and Suantarctic Metadata (CAASM - http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/metadata). Some data are also delivered through customised applications on the AADC wesite Data delivery systems, where appropriate, use international standards for data exchange and data discovery.

AADC staff assist in the capture of data at sea and on land, organise satellite tasking to support science campaigns, and provide advice on data collection methods.
