When someone comes to visit me, the first place I take them is to Shida Night Market so they can eat and shop their jet lag away! After stuffing our faces with Taiwanese sausages, braised pork on rice, pan-fried buns, and fresh pineapple juice, I lead them around the markets winding alleyways to peruse all manner of iPhone cases, weird clothing, pretty camera straps, and cheap stationery until the wee hours of the morning or until they drop from exhaustion. Welcome to TPE! Chinese New Year holiday is the best time to visit my city because Taipei reaches a fever-pitch frenzy of eating, drinking, and celebrating in preparation for the new year. The next morning, the city is suddenly empty, as nearly everyone travels south to visit their ancestral homes! You can see my city best from Elephant Mountain, a mere 15-minute walk from the city center. After scrambling up a set of winding stairs for a half hour and reaching a big rock, you will gasp when you see Taipei 101 rising out of the skyline right in front of you!
