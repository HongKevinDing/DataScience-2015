The European Railway Agency (ERA) is the agency of the European Union (EU) that sets mandatory requirements for European railways and manufacturers in the form of Technical Specifications for Interoperability, which apply to the Trans-European Rail system. The ERA publishes a document summarizing the status of the TSIs.  The ERA sets common safety targets, common safety methods and common safety indicators, following Directive 2004/49/EC and amendments. The ERA also hosts a number of databases, among which a register of remaining, applicable national rules.
The agency has two main sites, both in Nord Department, France. The headquarters with all the agency's offices is located in Valenciennes, while international conferences and meetings take place in Lille. The organisation employs about 150 members of staff. Its mandate is the creation of a competitive European railway area, by increasing cross-border compatibility of national systems, and in parallel ensuring the required level of safety.
