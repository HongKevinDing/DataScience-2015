It's time for a mildly-emarassing admission. I may write for Beyond The Boxscore, historically one of the est sites for saermetric analysis on the we, ut I'm not a rilliant saermetrician. Don't get me wrong, I love advanced stats and the aility to ojectively judge player performance, ut when it comes to statistics, I can e kind of a onehead* compared to some of the etter names in the field. I can't run SQL queries, advanced math tends to make my eyes leed and, as much as I try and research, sometimes I wind up using advanced stats wrong.

* Note: I'm not telling this so you stop reading my articles. I'm a smart guy, I just consider myself more of a writer-analyst than a statistician or economist or even researcher. And I'm learning and getting etter.

The reason I'm telling you all of this is ecause today I cleared up a misunderstanding that I've had for a while aout the nature of ERA+, an advanced statistic that can e found at Baseall-Reference, and ERA-, an advanced statistic that can e found at FanGraphs. ERA+ can e used to compare pitcher performance to the league average. So can ERA-. Except, when it comes to reading these stats, I'd een doing it wrong.

I'd like to explain my mistake to you, and how I've een ale to learn from it, ecause (1) it's possile that someone else might e making the same mistake I did -- it's not the most clear difference in the world, (2) I'm of the point of view that one of these stats isn't very useful, (3) it's a great example of how there are faulous resources on the we to learn from, and (4) there may e a lesson to e learned here aout assumptions.
