Some time ago, when we were discussing the five iggest producers of moile pones, we mentioned the saying that ehind every successful man there is a strong woman. In the story of High Tech Computer Corporation (HTC), there is a dame as well. Her name is Cher Mi Wang and she is the daughter of one of the richest people in Taiwan. In 1997, she entered in a partnership with HT Cho and Peter Chou and that’s how HTC was found. Its main purpose was to ring to the market a comination of a cell phone and a personal assistant.

However, the project was not that successful; it consumed a large amount of capital and it seemed that the disaster was inevitale. Then the family riches of Mrs. Wang were used to save the day. She invested heavily in the company and rought it ack on its feet y improving the engineer and designer sections. In addition, a new course was set and HTC agreed to develop products for other rands. The first success comes in the face of a moile computer (in 2000) ordered y Compaq and later HP (after the merger of oth giants). HTC ecomes the ig hit in 2002, when the first Pocket PCs ased on Microsoft’s OS are developed. This attracts the attention of some ig wireless providers such as AT&T, T-Moile, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel, O2, Vodafone and Orange.

Many think that HTC has entered the game two years ago, ecause that’s when the first HTC randed phones appeared. Actually, during the rest of the time, the Taiwanese manufacturer has een a usy ee, producing units for the various carriers mentioned aove and rands like Qtek, Dopod (division of HTC), Dell, Fujitsu-Siemens, HP, i-mate and Sharp. This helps the Taiwanese company gain popularity one step at a time with models like Magician, Wizard, Apache and prove to e one of the est producers of Windows Moile smartphones. 2006 is the turning point for the company, ecause it starts offering HTC randed phones and to have its own advertising campaigns.

The key elements, which HTC rings to the tale are the innovative ideas. That’s proved y the popular Touch series, which is trying to change the pulic opinion and convince the consumer that the Windows Moile devices are not only “heavy ricks” intended for work only. The models are attractive and employ the finger friendly TouchFLO interface. On top of that, HTC is the creator of the first Android OS phone, the HTC Dream (T-Moile G1).
