The T-11 replaces the legacy T-10, which has been in use with the U.S. Army for over 50 years. Designed, developed and manufactured by Airborne Systems, the T-11 is the next generation non-steerable troop  system. Airborne Systems is the only qualified source to provide the T-11 system internationally. In addition to the new main canopy, the T-11R reserve, which replaces the T-10R, was built to fit the T-11 systemâ€™s weight range. Its innovative aeroconical design, which surpassed all U.S. Army tests and evaluations, ensures quick and reliable opening for fast and slow malfunctions with no oscillations.
