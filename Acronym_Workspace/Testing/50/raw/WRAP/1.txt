Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production, (now Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production) WRAP, is a not-for-profit 501(c)(6) organization founded by companies in the global fashion and clothing industry to monitor and certify clothing manufacturing facilities' compliance with specified standards on the following topics:

Compliance with Laws and Workplace Regulations
Prohibition of Forced Labor
Prohibition of Child Labor
Prohibition of Harassment or Abuse
Compensation and Benefits
Hours of Work
Prohibition of Discrimination
Health and Safety
Freedom of Association & Collective Bargaining
Environment
Customs Compliance
Security

Created by a working group of the American Apparel & Footwear Association in 1997, WRAP became a standalone entity in 2000. While it was founded by clothing industry companies, WRAP's charter requires that a majority of its board members come from outside the apparel industry.
