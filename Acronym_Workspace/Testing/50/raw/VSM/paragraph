This chapter contains a brief introduction to the fundamental ideas on which the VSM is based. The intention is to set the scene, to give you an overview, to sketch out the outline. So do not try and thoroughly understand it all. If you get an idea of how it developed, what it is about and why it is different from most other models, then it is done its job. Consider this chapter as a quick journey through a country you may decide to visit and study at a later date. The VSM is more in tune with other whole systems ideas like acupuncture, the Gaia hypothesis, most of modern physics and many aspects of Eastern religions. The trouble is that most of us see the world in different terms which have their perspectives set by the world-view of Newton and Descartes.Artists in this category should have achieved national or international stature and prominence, and should be established names outside the performing arts community. They will have received reviews by major publications. The category encompasses all performing art forms and genres.
