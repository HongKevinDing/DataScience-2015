The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) operates a number of bus routes in Brooklyn, New York, United States; one minor route is privately operated under a city franchise. Many of them are the direct descendants of streetcar lines (see list of streetcar lines in Brooklyn); the ones that started out as bus routes were almost all operated by the Brooklyn Bus Corporation, a subsidiary of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, until the New York City Board of Transportation took over on June 5, 1940. Of the 55 local Brooklyn routes operated by the New York City Transit Authority, roughly 35 are the direct descendants of one or more streetcar lines, and most of the others were introduced in full or in part as new bus routes by the 1930s. Only the eastern section of the B82 (then the B50) and B83 were created by New York City Transit from scratch, in 1978 and 1966, respectively.

=== Route B110 ===

This route is operated by Private Transportation Corporation under a franchise with the City of New York, and is the lone unsubsidized route operating in Brooklyn. MetroCard is not accepted for payment of fare on this line, which has a one-way cash fare of US$3.00 .
In October 2011, the B110 was reported in several New York newspapers to have signs requiring female passengers to sit in the back to avoid possible contact with men, as is considered necessary by some Hassidic Jewish groups in the area it serves. The story was reported internationally. On October 20, the New York City Department of Transportation said it would shut down the line if the gender separation was not discontinued, but six days later, Private Transportation Corporation agreed to end this practice.
Currently, Private Transportation Corp. no longer enforces the Hasidic custom that men and women sit apart in social situations. But still most Hasidic men and women riders choose to sit apart each other and do not complain about segregation.
