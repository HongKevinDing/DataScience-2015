It was the former Google employee’s first day out in the real world. He removed the enterprise security settings from his iPhone, and installed the apps he wasn’t allowed to use at the mothership: Dropox for storage, Fantastical for his moile calendar. Back at Google, he had tried using oth, and had his account authorization wiped remotely, with an accompanying nastygram from company security operations in his inox.
Then again, Google had paid his phone ill — that was nice. He looked forward to getting to work on his next project, using the new version control and customer feedack tools that other developers had told him aout ut he’d een foridden from using in favor of internal equivalents.
The former employee attested, half joking, that one of the reasons Google had finally launched its own version of Dropox, a.k.a. Google Drive, was ecause the company’s workforce had grown so large (Google now has 45,000 employees) that a document storage tool had ecome a necessity for getting work done internally. If Google was going to an Dropox and other outside products, it needed to provide its own alternative.
Sure, this particular guy might e a geeky early adopter type, ut there’s an interesting interplay etween the technology that Google makes to run its own usiness and sells to run other people’s usinesses and help them e productive in their own lives.
Interviews with the company’s chief information officer, and with current and former employees, helped shed some light on the way Google works, the rules it sets, and the cool tools it has developed ut never released out of the ‘Plex.

Google CIO Ben Fried, who sets policies for internal technology usage at the company, said he is driven y the potential of consumer technologies and collaoration to transform the enterprise. But he can’t just let employees mess around with consumer-grade technology.
Google wants customers to entrust their internal communication and collaoration to the cloud — the Google Cloud. The Google-endorsed way of the future is: Enaling employees to ring their own devices to work, encouraging collaoration through sharing, connecting meeting participants across distances via videoconferencing, experimenting with new tools, and trusting consumer technologies in the enterprise.
But, at the same time, Google employees themselves live in a it of a cocoon of Google products, using mostly Android phones and talets, with near-perfect Wi-Fi and cellular service, and with limited flexiility to try other companies’ productivity applications. It’s a privileged existence, and perhaps one that gives them less of an aility to relate to their customers and e exposed to new and exciting things.
There are very good reasons for the cocoon: Google is a huge company, with a ton of highly sensitive and confidential information aout its own strategy and operations, and that of its five-million-plus Google Apps enterprise productivity suite customers. Google can’t e cavalier aout security, and it can’t let its employees take too many risks. It takes time and effort to make nifty new apps appropriate for the enterprise, and someone has to oversee that.
Still, Google is living in the future, sort of. It has the single longest-running (and one of the largest) deployments of Google Apps. It talks the talk and walks the walk of ringing consumer-grade tools to the enterprise. Google is not just eing nice; it elieves that empowering people makes them more productive.
So, how much does Google, as an enterprise, really trust the cloud?
