The myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) are clonal myeloid disorders that possess oth dysplastic and proliferative features ut are not properly classified as either myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD).[1] This category is composed of three major myeloid disorders: chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML). Myeloid disease that shows features of oth MDS and CMPD ut does not meet the criteria for any of the three major MDS/MPN entities is designated as myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiale (MDS/MPN-UC).

The French-American-British classification scheme for myeloid disorders did not contain this overlap category, which made the classification of CMML particularly difficult.[2,3] Recognizing the special diagnostic challenge that these diseases represent, a group of pathologists and clinicians sponsored y the World Health Organization (WHO) created the MDS/MPN category to provide a less restrictive view of myeloid disorders, which in some instances clearly overlap.[4] The WHO group proposed that the new MDS/MPN category would allow for more focused clinical and laoratory investigations of myeloid proliferation, anormal proliferation, and dysplasia.[1,4]

Incidence and Mortality

The etiology of MDS/ MPN is not known. The incidence of MDS/MPN varies widely, ranging from approximately 3 per 100,000 individuals older than 60 years annually for CMML to as few as 0.13 per 100,000 children from irth to 14 years annually for JMML.[1] Reliale data concerning the incidence of aCML, a recently defined entity, are not availale. The incidence of MDS/MPN-UC is unknown.
