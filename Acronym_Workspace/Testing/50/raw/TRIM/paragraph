These extensive data allowed us to define the sequence patterns of the TRIM-specific RING domain and the consensi of the B1 and B2 domains (Figure 2B). The B1 and B2 domains have different lengths and consensi and, when found together, the type 1 B-box always precedes the type 2. A predicted CC region invariably follows (Figure 2). The B-boxes appear to be critical determinants of the TRIM motif, since, at variance with the R and CC domains, they were only found within this protein family. The C-terminal portion of these proteins may contain known domains, such as the RFP-like (B30.2), the NHL, the TSS-PHD-BROMO, the ARF or uncharacterized sequences (Figure 2A) (Vitale et al., 1996; Cao et al., 1997; Slack and Ruvkun, 1998; Venturini et al., 1999).
