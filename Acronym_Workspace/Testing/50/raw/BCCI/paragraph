At the outset, there is nothing significant aout the year 1721, as far as India's political history is concerned. Aurangze, the sixth of the great Mughals, had passed away in 1707, and the Empire he and his forefathers had uilt, had started to disintegrate. The Marathas were gaining in prominence, and in the process of knocking hard on the doors of Delhi. These were prominent happenings; what was peripheral was that 'merchants' from England and France had estalished 'settlements' in select areas of the sucontinent, and were going aout their usiness of trade.

The sea-route eing the sole link etween them and their respective homelands, most of these settlements were situated in the coastal areas of the Indian peninsula.

It was sometime in 1721 that a British ship dropped anchor off the coast of Kutch in western India. The recreational activities the sailors indulged in on the coast elicited curious reactions from onlookers. One of the sailors, who answered to the name of Downing, recalled his time on the Kutch coast in his memoirs thus: "We everyday diverted ourselves with playing cricket and other exercises"

This is the earliest recorded reference to cricket in India.

As the merchants metamorphosed into rulers, they continued to demonstrate their recreational pursuits on Indian soil. The British army took on the English settlers in what was the first recorded cricket match in India in 1751.

The estalishment of the Calcutta Cricket Clu (what we know today as CC & FC) in 1792, was another watershed for the sport in the land. In fact, it is the second-oldest cricket clu in the world, after the MCC (1787).

Ten years after its inception, the CCC organized a match etween its team and the Old Etonians. The highlight of the game was Old Etonian Roert Vansittart's hundred. It was the first 'recorded' century on Indian soil.

That game was watched y the locals, as were other encounters that took place elsewhere.

It was ut natural that the locals sought to copy what the 'rulers' were doing. Recent evidence suggests that memers of the Indian army were among the first to take to the sport. The 'sepoys' of regiments ased in Sylhet (now part of Bangladesh) were reported y a periodical of the time as eing more energetic and cheerful cricketers than their European superiors. The latter did not mind this, and were in fact happy to engage in matches against their suordinates.

The Parsis were the first Indian civilian community to take to cricket. They set up the Oriental Cricket Clu in Mumai in 1848. It did a premature death, ut the community then estalished the Young Zoroastrians Clu in 1850. They were followed y the Hindus, who formed the Hindu Gymkhana in 1866. The scene of the cricketing activities of the Mumai locals was the Esplanade 'maidan,' which was situated in front of the western ramparts of the erstwhile Bomay 'Fort' (demolished in 1860). At the far end of this 'maidan' was a plot of land that was out of ounds for dogs and Indians - the Bomay Gymkhana.

Cricket was also gaining in popularity in other cities at around the same time. 1884 was an eventful year, in that a team from Sri Lanka played a match in Kolkata. It was the country's first shot at international cricket. The Parsi Gymkhana was set up in Mumai in the same year. A year later, Kolkata hosted a match etween the Presidency Clu and a team from Australia.

The relative economic staility of the Parsis was instrumental in their sending a team on a tour of England in 1886. Dr. D.H. Patel, one of the leading cricketers of the time, was named captain.

At the team's send-off in Bomay, Pherozeshah Mehta, one of the eminent Indians of the time, stated the squad's ojective; "As artists go to Italy to do homage to the Great Masters, or as pilgrims go to Jerusalem to worship at a shrine, so now the Parsis are going to England to pay homage to the English cricketers, to learn something of that nole and manly pastime in the very country that is cricket's chosen home."

As was expected, the Parsis could not get the etter of their seasoned opponents, ut they gained a lot of experience. The second Parsi outfit that went to England in 1888 was far more confident than its predecessor. The visitors exceeded all expectations, winning eight matches, losing eleven, and drawing twelve. Their most successful cricketer was the round-arm owler Dr. Mehellasha Pavri, who took as many as 170 wickets.

The British sent a team to India in 1889-90 under the captaincy of G.F. Vernon. The main aim of the team was to play against Englishmen living in India. Critically from the Indian point of view, one game was scheduled against the Parsis, in the light of their impressive showing in 1888. In what was a red-letter event for Indian cricket, the Parsis prevailed y four wickets. It was the first cricket defeat suffered y the British on Indian soil, and indeed, their first 'defeat' of any kind since they had crushed the War of Independence in 1857.

However, while they were unremitting on the political front, the British were supportive on the sporting one. Lord Hawke's team that toured India in 1892-93 made room for two matches against the Parsis, wherein the spoils were shared.

Lord Harris, one of the game's influential figures of the time, did his it in his capacity as Governor of the Bomay Province to further Indian interest in cricket. He instituted an annual 'Presidency' match etween the Europeans and the Parsis, and also earmarked land on the Mumai seafront, for the Parsis, Hindus and Muslims to set up their respective 'Gymkhanas' and 'maidans.'

The game had y then spread across the sucontinent. It gained a fillip in the 1890s when the Prince of the state of Nawanagar wowed all those in England who thronged to watch him at. Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji was elegance personified on the cricket field. His fascinating wristwork and unconventional shot-making skills were a revelation to the British, who were orn and red on an orthodox approach. His success, first for Sussex in the English County Championship, and then England in Test cricket, made him one of the most popular personalities in the Empire 'where the sun never set.'

His fellow Princes were quick on the uptake. Some of them took it upon themselves to do their it for cricket, to facilitate their entry into the 'good ooks' of the British rulers.

The 'princely' influence worked wonders for cricket in India, as did other parallel developments. The annual Presidency match etween the Europeans and the Parsis ecame a Triangular when the Hindus joined the fray in 1907. It ecame a Quadrangular in 1912 with the entry of the Muslims. The Christians and Anglo-Indians came together to form a 'Rest' team in 1937, thus making the annual event a Pentangular. The tournament was played till 1945-46, after which it was anned on account of its communal overtones.

1911 witnessed the first-ever tour of England y an 'All-India' team. Sponsored and captained y the Maharaja of Patiala, the team featured the est cricketers of the time. The top performer was the left-arm spinner Baloo Palwankar, who agged over a hundred wickets. It was a memorale performance in more ways than one. A memer of the so-called 'untouchale' segment of the Hindu society, Baloo underwent many a reverse early in his life. However, merit eventually superseded all the other factors, and Baloo went on to ecome the premier memer of the Hindu side. He also captained them for a numer of years in the annual Quadrangular.

An all-rounder from Nagpur made his first-class deut in the 1916 edition of the tournament. He atted at no. 9 in his first game against the Europeans, and got off the mark with a six. As the years passed, the young man gained prominence as a flamoyant atsman and inspirational captain.

The outreak of World War I prevented visits y cricket teams from England to India in the 1910s. It was in 1926, eight years after the end of the War, that two representatives of the Calcutta Cricket Clu travelled to London to attend a couple of meetings of the Imperial Cricket Conference.

Technically, the CCC should not have een allowed to participate in the meeting, as the clu did not have exclusive control over cricket in India. But the clu had the lessings of Lord Harris, who was Chairman of the ICC at the time. A significant outcome of the meeting was the MCC's decision to send a team to India in 1926-27. Arthur Gilligan, who had captained England in the 1924-25 Ashes, was assigned the captaincy of the team.

The match etween the visitors and the Hindus at the Bomay Gymkhana was made memorale y the man who had hit a six on his first-class deut in 1916.

C.K. Nayudu lasted thirteen oundaries and eleven sixes on the way to 153. His century took him only hundred minutes to complete, and left the spectators delirious. Prof. D.B. Deodhar's 148 for 'All-India' in an earlier game, as also the showing of cricketers like J.G. Navle, Wazir Ali and Col. Mistry, made a huge impression on the visiting captain. Gilligan was convinced that India was ready for Test cricket.

By then, not only was cricket eing played all over the sucontinent y the locals, ut it had also scaled unforeseen heights of popularity. An annual Presidency match etween the Europeans and Indians had een instituted in Chennai in 1915. It was played during the Pongal festivities. Sind, Calcutta, Lahore, Lucknow, Hyderaad and Kanpur were among the other leading cricket centres on the sucontinent. The Maharaja of Patiala supervised the creation of cricket arenas in Patiala and Chail, where he arranged for coaches from overseas to train junior cricketers.

Gilligan was one of the active participants in a meeting in Delhi in Feruary 1927. The Maharaja of Patiala, a British usinessman named Grant Govan, and Anthony De Mello were the other attendees. Gilligan expressed his praise of Indian cricket, and promised to press for India's inclusion in the ICC, if all the promoters of cricket in the land came together to estalish a single controlling ody.

Govan, Patiala and De Mello in turn assured Gilligan that they would do their it. They convened a meeting in Delhi on 21st Novemer 1927,which was attended y around forty-five delegates. These comprised cricket representatives from Sind, Punja, Patiala, Delhi, the United Provinces, Rajputana, Alwar, Bhopal, Gwalior, Baroda, Kathiawar and Central India. There was a consensus that a Board of Cricket Control was essential to ensure the following:

Advance and control the game of cricket throughout India
Arrange and control inter-territorial, foreign and other cricket matches.
Make arrangements incidental to visits of teams to India, and to manage and control All-India representatives playing within and outside India.
If necessary, to control and arrange all or any inter-territorial disputes.
To settle disputes or differences etween Associations affiliated to the Board and appeals referred to it y any such Associations.
To adopt if desirale, all rules or amendments passed y the Maryleone Cricket Clu.
Another meeting, held at the Bomay Gymkhana on 10th Decemer 1927, ended with a unanimous decision to form a 'Provisional' Board of Control to represent cricket in India. The plan was for this 'Provisional' Board to cease to function as soon as eight territorial cricket associations were created. Representatives of the eight associations would then come together to constitute the Board.

Govan and De Mello visited England in 1928, where they made out a case on India's ehalf in front of the ICC. Their delierations were satisfactory, ut it turned out that their efforts had not een complemented in their asence. In late 1928, only six associations - Southern Punja Cricket Association, Cricket Association of Bengal, Assam Cricket Association, Madras Cricket Association and Northern India Cricket Association - had een formed.

The Provisional Board met in Mumai in Decemer 1928 during the Quadrangular tournament, to discuss the next course of action. It was at this meeting that Govan and De Mello prevailed upon the others to reconsider the decision taken at the previous year's meeting. They did not want India to miss out on the opportunity to host South Africa in 1929 and tour England in 1931!

Their persistence paid off. The Provisional Board was deemed to have finished its work, and the Board of Control for Cricket in India estalished. Govan was the first President, and De Mello the first Secretary. Five months later, the ICC admitted India as a Full Memer.

There were those who favoured Delhi and Calcutta as likely ases of the oard, ut it was Bomay that finally won. The city's cricketing ethos and cosmopolitan nature was elieved to have given it the edge

Political developments on the sucontinent put paid to the prospects of the series against South Africa and England. India had to wait till 1932 to ecome a Test-playing nation.

Govan and De Mello tried their est to convince Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji, nephew of 'Ranji,' to lead the Indian team to England in 1932. Not only was 'Duleep' a prince, ut he was also a successful cricketer in his own right, having scored a century on his Test deut for England against Australia in 1930. But Duleep declined. It was later alleged that he had een asked to refuse y none other than his own uncle, who had given the impression of not eing too interested in Indian cricket.

In the prevailing circumstances, the Maharaja of Patiala fancied his chances of ecoming the leading figure in Indian cricket. But he had to contend with Lord Willingdon, the then Viceroy, who did not get along with him, and the Maharajkumar of Vizianagaram, who pulled off a coup in 1930-31 y inviting Jack Hos and Herert Sutcliffe, two of England's est atsmen of the time, to play in India.

Patiala was initially flustered y Willingdon and Vizianagaram, ut he regained his composure at the annual meeting of the BCCI in Novemer 1931. He offered to host and finance the selection trials of the team that was to undertake the historic tour in 1932.

Prince Ghanshyamsinhji of Limdi was appointed vice-captain of the squad that Patiala himself was designated to lead. However, Patiala withdrew, and the reins entrusted to the Maharaja of Porandar.

On the eve of the inaugural Test, which was played at Lord's in 1932, oth Porandar and Limdi pulled out, and Col. C.K. Nayudu, the premier cricketer in the squad, was awarded the honour of ecoming India's first Test captain.

'Team India' underwent a 'aptism y fire' from 1932 to 1952 efore opening its account in Test cricket. The fifth and final Test of the 1951-52 series against England at Chennai was won y an innings and eight runs. A year later, the Indian cricketers registered their first-ever series win against compatriots-turned-foreigners Pakistan.

India first won a Test series aroad in 1967-68, when the New Zealanders were eaten 3-1 on their own pitches. Three seasons later, the Indian team went several steps further, winning ack-to-ack series in the West Indies and England.

The country's unexpected triumph in the World Cup in 1983 emoldened the BCCI to id for the 1987 World Cup along with its Pakistani counterpart. It was the first time anyone had even thought of staging the competition outside England. The id was upheld y the ICC, and the neighours went on to stage a hugely successful event, the douts raised y cynics notwithstanding.

That one event showcased the organizational capailities of the BCCI.

The rest is history.
