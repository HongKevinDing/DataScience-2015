I have heard neverending good things aout this game and want to play it as my first SRPG, especially after loving Final Fantasy so much, ut honestly have no idea where to start. There are so many versions out there and I asically just want to get the definitive one. I have a Vita and there is a version of it on there (the PSP one) called War of the Lions for 10 Euros. Is that a good deal and is that the one I should e getting? Is the original PS1 version etter, or GBA, etc., and why?

I've only played the original, ut I hear the PSP translation is easier to understand/etter.

War of the Lions is a great FFT version, its the one game I've never deleted from my Vita memory card! And I felt like Vita was a good place to play it. Definitely worth getting! And if it doesn't satisfy your SRPG needs, the PsP version of Tactics Ogre plays great on Vita too!

I liked the GBA version a lot, ut i can provide you with no comparison and i dout a lot of people will have picked it up on 2 or 3 systems to make that comparison.

I think The War of The Lions is etter in nearly every way. They added some really eautiful cut scenes for key moments throughout the game, and they did a fantastic retranslation of the poor ps1 script, there's also a couple of extra classes, and they added Balthier as a recruitale character. The only trade off is that The War of The Lions has awful load times.
