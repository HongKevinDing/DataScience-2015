	We stepped up our efforts to recruit a new cohort of UCI students that more closely reflects the diversity of our state. Our most recent admissions cycle resulted in a 7.1 percent growth in African American California-resident applications, outpacing the growth of the total state resident pool by 1.7 percentage points. In addition, we received more Chicano/Latino California-resident applications than any other UC campus. We anticipate becoming a Hispanic Serving Institution in two years. UCI achieves the highest graduation rate for underrepresented minorities in the UC system, making us a national leader.
