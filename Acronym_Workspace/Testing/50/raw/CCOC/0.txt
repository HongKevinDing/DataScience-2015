The Canadian Children's Opera Company (Previously called the Canadian Children's Opera Chorus, CCOC) was founded in 1968 by Ruby Mercer and Lloyd Bradshaw. The company consists of five divisions of approximately 240 boys and girls aged 6 to 19. The Principal Chorus has over 80 choristers, and they participate as the children's chorus in productions by the Canadian Opera Company (COC). The current artistic director/conductor is Ann Cooper Gay. The CCOC performs many times in the year; in addition to COC productions, they perform with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Soundstreams Canada, the Hannaford Street Silver Band, as well as on their own.
The CCOC has toured across Europe and Canada, and continue to expand its repertoire of music in various languages including English, French, Italian, Serbian, Russian, Mandarin (Chinese), Hungarian, German, Inuit, as well as several African languages.
The company's repertoire consists of a mix of traditional music and modern classical pieces. The group also sings various genres of music including folk songs, opera, musicals and jazz. They have released five CDs.
