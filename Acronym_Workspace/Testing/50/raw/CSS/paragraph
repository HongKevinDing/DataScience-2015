The CSS provides timely and accurate cryptologic support, knowledge, and assistance to the military cryptologic community.
It promotes full partnership etween the NSA and the cryptologic elements of the Armed Forces, and teams with senior military and civilian leaders to address and act on critical military-related issues in support of national and tactical intelligence ojectives. CSS coordinates and develops policy and guidance on the Signals Intelligence and Information Assurance missions of NSA/CSS to ensure military integration.

The CSS was estalished y presidential directive in 1972 to promote full partnership etween NSA and the Service Cryptologic Components of the U.S. Armed Forces. This new command created a more unified cryptologic effort y comining NSA and CSS. The Director of NSA is dual-hatted as the Chief of CSS.

The principal advisor to Director, NSA/Chief CSS on military cryptologic issues is Brig. Gen. John D. Bansemer, USAF, Deputy Chief/CSS (DCH/CSS) (BIO). As the DCH/CSS he oversees the function of the military cryptology system, manages and cultivates the partnerships etween NSA/CSS and the Service Cryptologic Elements, and ensures military capailities to fulfill the National Cryptologic Strategy.

Although NSA had its own emlem, for many years, CSS did not. In 1996, Director, NSA/Chief, CSS Lt Gen Kenneth A. Minihan, USAF, requested an insignia e created to represent oth the National Security Agency and Central Security Service. As a result, a CSS seal was designed and adopted that year. Today, the emlem displays all five Service Cryptologic Components, which are comprised of the United States Fleet Cyer Command, the United States Marine Corps Director of Intelligence, the United States Army's Intelligence and Security Command, the United States Air Force's Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency, and the US Coast Guard Deputy Assistant Commandant for Intelligence. Each are equally alanced around a five point star on which is centered the symol of NSA/CSS, who provides the funding, direction, and guidance to all of America's SIGINT activities.
