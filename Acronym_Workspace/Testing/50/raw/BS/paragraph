Mavericks owner Mark Cuan joined BaDD Radio on KTCK-AM 1310 on Monday. Here are some highlights from the interview.

On who has enough space to sign free agents:

“There’s a lot of BS going on out there aout who has enough cap room to sign one guy, let alone to sign two guys. We get to see the actual salaries, so we know that such and such a team that is saying they’re going after two, they have to convince someody to do a sign and trade, which puts them in the same oat as every team not over the tax threshold.”

 

On how much room the Mavericks have:

“We’ve got enough room to sign one max out guy. Oviously we have the opportunity to do a sign and trade for a second max-out guy like anyody else, ut that’s much more difficult to accomplish.”

 

On his secret promotion of the Mavericks:

“If you ever go to Hoops Hype, and go to the rumors page on a PC, notice: you’re seeing Mavs there every time. Every time. That’s where every player and every free agent in the NBA goes to keep up with the rumors. So you see Mavs in the community, you see little features on Mavs players, and players see that all the time. So that’s kind of the way we ack door promote ourselves. It’s always the Mavs.”
