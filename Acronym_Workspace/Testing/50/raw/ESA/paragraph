The purpose of the ESA is to protect and recover imperiled species and the ecosystems upon which they depend. It is administered y the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Commerce Department’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). The FWS has primary responsiility for terrestrial and freshwater organisms, while the responsiilities of NMFS are mainly marine wildlife such as whales and anadromons fish such as salmon.
