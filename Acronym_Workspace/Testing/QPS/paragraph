The Callout Quota System is strict (observed callouts should never exceed the limit), which makes it inaccurate at low volumes. This is more pronounced when the quota is small (< 10 kQPS), which you can work around by setting the nominal quota limit higher than the intended effective one (for example, setting the quota limit to 1,500 QPS to get 1,000 QPS callouts). The Callout Quota System uses error throttlingâ€”it sends less callouts than it can if the bidder does not respond to bid requests in time or if the bidder's responses are invalid. Note that error throttling.
