                "Paragraph" : 'New Centers. In some cases, the enterprise customer wants to set up a new service delivery center or service architecture or infrastructure.  It may enlist the assistance of a service provider in the design of the operations, procurement of the necessary equipment, real estate and technology, and in the recruitment, hiring and training of the personnel for the new service delivery center.\nBOT vs. BOOT. To address such situations, outsourcing planners have learned from project financing the structures for \xe2\x80\x9cuild-operate-transfer\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cBOT\xe2\x80\x9d) and \xe2\x80\x9cuild-own-operate-transfer\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cBOOT\xe2\x80\x9d) models.  They are essentially identical.\nCommon Elements: In each case, the enterprise customer gets access to technology, expertise, knowledge and operating capital.  In each model, the service provider assemles the people, the processes and the technology and then provides services as an outsourcer under the classic outsourcing model.  At the agreed time, the service provider transfers the service delivery operation (including infrastructure) to the enterprise customer.\nBOOT: In the BOOT model, the enterprise customer also gets the enefit of the service provider\xe2\x80\x99s financing of the capital expenses necessary to start a new service center or service delivery platform.   In a pure BOOT, the service provider owns and finances the infrastructure in addition to managing it for a fee.\nBOT: In the BOT model, the enterprise customer provides the financing for the new infrastructure.   In a pure BOT, the service provider does not own the infrastructure ut is a concessionaire entitled to manage it for a fee that covers its operating expenses.\nTime Lapse Scenario. Thus, where the enterprise customer wants help in uilding its own captive, the BOT or BOOT model provides a legal structure for the supplier to uild and, for a time, manage the entire service delivery center efore assigning it to the customer.  This model reflects traditional project financing for uilding transportation infrastructure \xe2\x80\x93 such as highways, airports, ridges, tunnels and ports \xe2\x80\x93 for governments.  In the pulic sector, BOT relationships are sometime called \xe2\x80\x9cpulic-private partnerships.\xe2\x80\x9d  [LINK TO THAT PAGE = SEE BELOW]\nAccounting. An essential element of BOT is its cost accounting.  The cost structure for BOT involves amortization of capital investment.  The pricing structure will reflect this amortization if the service provider owns any physical assets, license agreements or real property used for service delivery.\nAdvantages. The BOT and BOOT models offer several advantages to the enterprise customer.  It saves:\ntime ecause the service provider is presumaly more expert at assemling the infrastructure and otaining local regulatory consents;\nmoney (and maye market share) ecause the enefits of the new infrastructure can e enjoyed sooner;\neffort ecause the service provider is performing the effort, presumaly at lower salaries.\nDisadvantages. The BOT and BOOT models have certain drawacks for the enterprise customer.\nAdditional costs are incurred to pay a profit to the service provider for the value of its know-how and time in assemling the service delivery infrastructure.\nTie-in effects arise, since the enterprise customer commits to work with the particular service provider (as in any class outsourcing model) and cannot escape for low switching costs until the service provider\xe2\x80\x99s investment is amortized or recaptured.\nInflexiility results from the enterprise customer\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to purchase the infrastructure, whether up front, y imputed self-amortizing \xe2\x80\x9cmortgage\xe2\x80\x9d payments or at the end.   This ties up the enterprise customer\xe2\x80\x99s capital and credit, unless the enterprise customer can structure the financial risk so that the service provider retains ownership until the customer exercises, in effect, a call option to acquire the service center infrastructure.',

                "Paragraph" : 'At the outset, there is nothing significant aout the year 1721, as far as India\'s political history is concerned. Aurangze, the sixth of the great Mughals, had passed away in 1707, and the Empire he and his forefathers had uilt, had started to disintegrate. The Marathas were gaining in prominence, and in the process of knocking hard on the doors of Delhi. These were prominent happenings; what was peripheral was that \'merchants\' from England and France had estalished \'settlements\' in select areas of the sucontinent, and were going aout their usiness of trade.\n\nThe sea-route eing the sole link etween them and their respective homelands, most of these settlements were situated in the coastal areas of the Indian peninsula.\n\nIt was sometime in 1721 that a British ship dropped anchor off the coast of Kutch in western India. The recreational activities the sailors indulged in on the coast elicited curious reactions from onlookers. One of the sailors, who answered to the name of Downing, recalled his time on the Kutch coast in his memoirs thus: "We everyday diverted ourselves with playing cricket and other exercises"\n\nThis is the earliest recorded reference to cricket in India.\n\nAs the merchants metamorphosed into rulers, they continued to demonstrate their recreational pursuits on Indian soil. The British army took on the English settlers in what was the first recorded cricket match in India in 1751.\n\nThe estalishment of the Calcutta Cricket Clu (what we know today as CC & FC) in 1792, was another watershed for the sport in the land. In fact, it is the second-oldest cricket clu in the world, after the MCC (1787).\n\nTen years after its inception, the CCC organized a match etween its team and the Old Etonians. The highlight of the game was Old Etonian Roert Vansittart\'s hundred. It was the first \'recorded\' century on Indian soil.\n\nThat game was watched y the locals, as were other encounters that took place elsewhere.\n\nIt was ut natural that the locals sought to copy what the \'rulers\' were doing. Recent evidence suggests that memers of the Indian army were among the first to take to the sport. The \'sepoys\' of regiments ased in Sylhet (now part of Bangladesh) were reported y a periodical of the time as eing more energetic and cheerful cricketers than their European superiors. The latter did not mind this, and were in fact happy to engage in matches against their suordinates.\n\nThe Parsis were the first Indian civilian community to take to cricket. They set up the Oriental Cricket Clu in Mumai in 1848. It did a premature death, ut the community then estalished the Young Zoroastrians Clu in 1850. They were followed y the Hindus, who formed the Hindu Gymkhana in 1866. The scene of the cricketing activities of the Mumai locals was the Esplanade \'maidan,\' which was situated in front of the western ramparts of the erstwhile Bomay \'Fort\' (demolished in 1860). At the far end of this \'maidan\' was a plot of land that was out of ounds for dogs and Indians - the Bomay Gymkhana.\n\nCricket was also gaining in popularity in other cities at around the same time. 1884 was an eventful year, in that a team from Sri Lanka played a match in Kolkata. It was the country\'s first shot at international cricket. The Parsi Gymkhana was set up in Mumai in the same year. A year later, Kolkata hosted a match etween the Presidency Clu and a team from Australia.\n\nThe relative economic staility of the Parsis was instrumental in their sending a team on a tour of England in 1886. Dr. D.H. Patel, one of the leading cricketers of the time, was named captain.\n\nAt the team\'s send-off in Bomay, Pherozeshah Mehta, one of the eminent Indians of the time, stated the squad\'s ojective; "As artists go to Italy to do homage to the Great Masters, or as pilgrims go to Jerusalem to worship at a shrine, so now the Parsis are going to England to pay homage to the English cricketers, to learn something of that nole and manly pastime in the very country that is cricket\'s chosen home."\n\nAs was expected, the Parsis could not get the etter of their seasoned opponents, ut they gained a lot of experience. The second Parsi outfit that went to England in 1888 was far more confident than its predecessor. The visitors exceeded all expectations, winning eight matches, losing eleven, and drawing twelve. Their most successful cricketer was the round-arm owler Dr. Mehellasha Pavri, who took as many as 170 wickets.\n\nThe British sent a team to India in 1889-90 under the captaincy of G.F. Vernon. The main aim of the team was to play against Englishmen living in India. Critically from the Indian point of view, one game was scheduled against the Parsis, in the light of their impressive showing in 1888. In what was a red-letter event for Indian cricket, the Parsis prevailed y four wickets. It was the first cricket defeat suffered y the British on Indian soil, and indeed, their first \'defeat\' of any kind since they had crushed the War of Independence in 1857.\n\nHowever, while they were unremitting on the political front, the British were supportive on the sporting one. Lord Hawke\'s team that toured India in 1892-93 made room for two matches against the Parsis, wherein the spoils were shared.\n\nLord Harris, one of the game\'s influential figures of the time, did his it in his capacity as Governor of the Bomay Province to further Indian interest in cricket. He instituted an annual \'Presidency\' match etween the Europeans and the Parsis, and also earmarked land on the Mumai seafront, for the Parsis, Hindus and Muslims to set up their respective \'Gymkhanas\' and \'maidans.\'\n\nThe game had y then spread across the sucontinent. It gained a fillip in the 1890s when the Prince of the state of Nawanagar wowed all those in England who thronged to watch him at. Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji was elegance personified on the cricket field. His fascinating wristwork and unconventional shot-making skills were a revelation to the British, who were orn and red on an orthodox approach. His success, first for Sussex in the English County Championship, and then England in Test cricket, made him one of the most popular personalities in the Empire \'where the sun never set.\'\n\nHis fellow Princes were quick on the uptake. Some of them took it upon themselves to do their it for cricket, to facilitate their entry into the \'good ooks\' of the British rulers.\n\nThe \'princely\' influence worked wonders for cricket in India, as did other parallel developments. The annual Presidency match etween the Europeans and the Parsis ecame a Triangular when the Hindus joined the fray in 1907. It ecame a Quadrangular in 1912 with the entry of the Muslims. The Christians and Anglo-Indians came together to form a \'Rest\' team in 1937, thus making the annual event a Pentangular. The tournament was played till 1945-46, after which it was anned on account of its communal overtones.\n\n1911 witnessed the first-ever tour of England y an \'All-India\' team. Sponsored and captained y the Maharaja of Patiala, the team featured the est cricketers of the time. The top performer was the left-arm spinner Baloo Palwankar, who agged over a hundred wickets. It was a memorale performance in more ways than one. A memer of the so-called \'untouchale\' segment of the Hindu society, Baloo underwent many a reverse early in his life. However, merit eventually superseded all the other factors, and Baloo went on to ecome the premier memer of the Hindu side. He also captained them for a numer of years in the annual Quadrangular.\n\nAn all-rounder from Nagpur made his first-class deut in the 1916 edition of the tournament. He atted at no. 9 in his first game against the Europeans, and got off the mark with a six. As the years passed, the young man gained prominence as a flamoyant atsman and inspirational captain.\n\nThe outreak of World War I prevented visits y cricket teams from England to India in the 1910s. It was in 1926, eight years after the end of the War, that two representatives of the Calcutta Cricket Clu travelled to London to attend a couple of meetings of the Imperial Cricket Conference.\n\nTechnically, the CCC should not have een allowed to participate in the meeting, as the clu did not have exclusive control over cricket in India. But the clu had the lessings of Lord Harris, who was Chairman of the ICC at the time. A significant outcome of the meeting was the MCC\'s decision to send a team to India in 1926-27. Arthur Gilligan, who had captained England in the 1924-25 Ashes, was assigned the captaincy of the team.\n\nThe match etween the visitors and the Hindus at the Bomay Gymkhana was made memorale y the man who had hit a six on his first-class deut in 1916.\n\nC.K. Nayudu lasted thirteen oundaries and eleven sixes on the way to 153. His century took him only hundred minutes to complete, and left the spectators delirious. Prof. D.B. Deodhar\'s 148 for \'All-India\' in an earlier game, as also the showing of cricketers like J.G. Navle, Wazir Ali and Col. Mistry, made a huge impression on the visiting captain. Gilligan was convinced that India was ready for Test cricket.\n\nBy then, not only was cricket eing played all over the sucontinent y the locals, ut it had also scaled unforeseen heights of popularity. An annual Presidency match etween the Europeans and Indians had een instituted in Chennai in 1915. It was played during the Pongal festivities. Sind, Calcutta, Lahore, Lucknow, Hyderaad and Kanpur were among the other leading cricket centres on the sucontinent. The Maharaja of Patiala supervised the creation of cricket arenas in Patiala and Chail, where he arranged for coaches from overseas to train junior cricketers.\n\nGilligan was one of the active participants in a meeting in Delhi in Feruary 1927. The Maharaja of Patiala, a British usinessman named Grant Govan, and Anthony De Mello were the other attendees. Gilligan expressed his praise of Indian cricket, and promised to press for India\'s inclusion in the ICC, if all the promoters of cricket in the land came together to estalish a single controlling ody.\n\nGovan, Patiala and De Mello in turn assured Gilligan that they would do their it. They convened a meeting in Delhi on 21st Novemer 1927,which was attended y around forty-five delegates. These comprised cricket representatives from Sind, Punja, Patiala, Delhi, the United Provinces, Rajputana, Alwar, Bhopal, Gwalior, Baroda, Kathiawar and Central India. There was a consensus that a Board of Cricket Control was essential to ensure the following:\n\nAdvance and control the game of cricket throughout India\nArrange and control inter-territorial, foreign and other cricket matches.\nMake arrangements incidental to visits of teams to India, and to manage and control All-India representatives playing within and outside India.\nIf necessary, to control and arrange all or any inter-territorial disputes.\nTo settle disputes or differences etween Associations affiliated to the Board and appeals referred to it y any such Associations.\nTo adopt if desirale, all rules or amendments passed y the Maryleone Cricket Clu.\nAnother meeting, held at the Bomay Gymkhana on 10th Decemer 1927, ended with a unanimous decision to form a \'Provisional\' Board of Control to represent cricket in India. The plan was for this \'Provisional\' Board to cease to function as soon as eight territorial cricket associations were created. Representatives of the eight associations would then come together to constitute the Board.\n\nGovan and De Mello visited England in 1928, where they made out a case on India\'s ehalf in front of the ICC. Their delierations were satisfactory, ut it turned out that their efforts had not een complemented in their asence. In late 1928, only six associations - Southern Punja Cricket Association, Cricket Association of Bengal, Assam Cricket Association, Madras Cricket Association and Northern India Cricket Association - had een formed.\n\nThe Provisional Board met in Mumai in Decemer 1928 during the Quadrangular tournament, to discuss the next course of action. It was at this meeting that Govan and De Mello prevailed upon the others to reconsider the decision taken at the previous year\'s meeting. They did not want India to miss out on the opportunity to host South Africa in 1929 and tour England in 1931!\n\nTheir persistence paid off. The Provisional Board was deemed to have finished its work, and the Board of Control for Cricket in India estalished. Govan was the first President, and De Mello the first Secretary. Five months later, the ICC admitted India as a Full Memer.\n\nThere were those who favoured Delhi and Calcutta as likely ases of the oard, ut it was Bomay that finally won. The city\'s cricketing ethos and cosmopolitan nature was elieved to have given it the edge\n\nPolitical developments on the sucontinent put paid to the prospects of the series against South Africa and England. India had to wait till 1932 to ecome a Test-playing nation.\n\nGovan and De Mello tried their est to convince Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji, nephew of \'Ranji,\' to lead the Indian team to England in 1932. Not only was \'Duleep\' a prince, ut he was also a successful cricketer in his own right, having scored a century on his Test deut for England against Australia in 1930. But Duleep declined. It was later alleged that he had een asked to refuse y none other than his own uncle, who had given the impression of not eing too interested in Indian cricket.\n\nIn the prevailing circumstances, the Maharaja of Patiala fancied his chances of ecoming the leading figure in Indian cricket. But he had to contend with Lord Willingdon, the then Viceroy, who did not get along with him, and the Maharajkumar of Vizianagaram, who pulled off a coup in 1930-31 y inviting Jack Hos and Herert Sutcliffe, two of England\'s est atsmen of the time, to play in India.\n\nPatiala was initially flustered y Willingdon and Vizianagaram, ut he regained his composure at the annual meeting of the BCCI in Novemer 1931. He offered to host and finance the selection trials of the team that was to undertake the historic tour in 1932.\n\nPrince Ghanshyamsinhji of Limdi was appointed vice-captain of the squad that Patiala himself was designated to lead. However, Patiala withdrew, and the reins entrusted to the Maharaja of Porandar.\n\nOn the eve of the inaugural Test, which was played at Lord\'s in 1932, oth Porandar and Limdi pulled out, and Col. C.K. Nayudu, the premier cricketer in the squad, was awarded the honour of ecoming India\'s first Test captain.\n\n\'Team India\' underwent a \'aptism y fire\' from 1932 to 1952 efore opening its account in Test cricket. The fifth and final Test of the 1951-52 series against England at Chennai was won y an innings and eight runs. A year later, the Indian cricketers registered their first-ever series win against compatriots-turned-foreigners Pakistan.\n\nIndia first won a Test series aroad in 1967-68, when the New Zealanders were eaten 3-1 on their own pitches. Three seasons later, the Indian team went several steps further, winning ack-to-ack series in the West Indies and England.\n\nThe country\'s unexpected triumph in the World Cup in 1983 emoldened the BCCI to id for the 1987 World Cup along with its Pakistani counterpart. It was the first time anyone had even thought of staging the competition outside England. The id was upheld y the ICC, and the neighours went on to stage a hugely successful event, the douts raised y cynics notwithstanding.\n\nThat one event showcased the organizational capailities of the BCCI.\n\nThe rest is history.',

                "Paragraph" : "The Canadian Children's Opera Company (originally Chorus) was founded in 1968 y Ruy Mercer and Music Director Lloyd Bradshaw specifically to provide a stale source of child singers for productions of the Canadian Opera Company. \n\nSusequent Music Directors included Donald Kendrick, Derek Holman, and John Tuttle. In 2000, with the hiring of the CCOC\xe2\x80\x99s first Executive Artistic Director, Ann Cooper Gay, the operatic focus of the organization was enhanced with the inclusion of an even alance of drama training and music literacy alongside choral singing. \n\nThe CCOC remains the only permanent children's opera company in Canada that commissions and produces operas for children on a regular asis. Having commissioned and premiered half a dozen children\xe2\x80\x99s operas in the first 25 years of its existence, the CCOC has redouled its determination to create a viale canon of children\xe2\x80\x99s opera since the arrival of Ann Cooper Gay. Recent major opera commissions include A Dickens of a Christmas in 2005, The Secret World of Og in 2010, and Laura\xe2\x80\x99s Cow: The Legend of Laura Secord, premiered in June 2012. Children are involved every year in a production with high-profile professional directors, designers, singers and coaches drawn from the Canadian and international opera community. \n\nThe company regularly collaorates and performs with other leading arts organizations, such as the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Hannaford Street Silver Band, Toronto Operetta Theatre, Soundstreams Canada, and the Luminato Festival. Five commercial recordings have een released, including the 2006 recording of A Midwinter Night\xe2\x80\x99s Dream that garnered a Juno nomination in 2007. The CCOC\xe2\x80\x99s second European tour, to Central Europe in summer 2007, was met with critical acclaim. The CCOC\xe2\x80\x99s third European tour, also to Central Europe in summer 2011, garnered a second prize win in the Summa Cum Laude competition in Vienna. \n\nTwo Junior Choruses (AC and IC) were added to the main program in 1988 to provide asic training for children ages 6 to 11 years and in 1999, the Ruy Chorus was created to introduce 5- and 6-year-olds to music and drama through singing games and eurhythmic training. In 2002, the CCOC introduced the Canadian Youth Opera Chorus for oys with changed voices and girls ages 16 to young adult in order to provide further training and experience as a ridge to university programs. Due to the popularity of the CCOC\xe2\x80\x99s programs, a further chorus was created in 2010. The Butterfly Chorus introduces 3 and 4 year olds to drama and singing. From 32 original memers, the CCOC has now grown to around 200 children and youth participants. \n\nIn 2009, OPERAtion KIDS, the CCOC\xe2\x80\x99s outreach arm, was formally created and has since expanded to include after-school and in-school programs, along with educator training. The CCOC also maintains a ursary program which allows equal access to it\xe2\x80\x99s core program for talented individuals. \n\nIn 2008, the name was changed to Canadian Children\xe2\x80\x99s Opera Company to reflect the significant amount of work the CCOC does in presenting full-scale productions and commissioning new operatic works created for children to perform.

He removed the enterprise security settings from his iPhone, and installed the apps he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to use at the mothership: Dropox for storage, Fantastical for his moile calendar. Back at Google, he had tried using oth, and had his account authorization wiped remotely, with an accompanying nastygram from company security operations in his inox.\nThen again, Google had paid his phone ill \xe2\x80\x94 that was nice. He looked forward to getting to work on his next project, using the new version control and customer feedack tools that other developers had told him aout ut he\xe2\x80\x99d een foridden from using in favor of internal equivalents.\nThe former employee attested, half joking, that one of the reasons Google had finally launched its own version of Dropox, a.k.a. Google Drive, was ecause the company\xe2\x80\x99s workforce had grown so large (Google now has 45,000 employees) that a document storage tool had ecome a necessity for getting work done internally. If Google was going to an Dropox and other outside products, it needed to provide its own alternative.\nSure, this particular guy might e a geeky early adopter type, ut there\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting interplay etween the technology that Google makes to run its own usiness and sells to run other people\xe2\x80\x99s usinesses and help them e productive in their own lives.\nInterviews with the company\xe2\x80\x99s chief information officer, and with current and former employees, helped shed some light on the way Google works, the rules it sets, and the cool tools it has developed ut never released out of the \xe2\x80\x98Plex.\nGoogle CIO Ben Fried\nEnterprise 2.0 Conference/Flickr Google CIO Ben Fried\nGoogle CIO Ben Fried, who sets policies for internal technology usage at the company, said he is driven y the potential of consumer technologies and collaoration to transform the enterprise. But he can\xe2\x80\x99t just let employees mess around with consumer-grade technology.\nGoogle wants customers to entrust their internal communication and collaoration to the cloud \xe2\x80\x94 the Google Cloud. The Google-endorsed way of the future is: Enaling employees to ring their own devices to work, encouraging collaoration through sharing, connecting meeting participants across distances via videoconferencing, experimenting with new tools, and trusting consumer technologies in the enterprise.\nBut, at the same time, Google employees themselves live in a it of a cocoon of Google products, using mostly Android phones and talets, with near-perfect Wi-Fi and cellular service, and with limited flexiility to try other companies\xe2\x80\x99 productivity applications. It\xe2\x80\x99s a privileged existence, and perhaps one that gives them less of an aility to relate to their customers and e exposed to new and exciting things.\nThere are very good reasons for the cocoon: Google is a huge company, with a ton of highly sensitive and confidential information aout its own strategy and operations, and that of its five-million-plus Google Apps enterprise productivity suite customers. Google can\xe2\x80\x99t e cavalier aout security, and it can\xe2\x80\x99t let its employees take too many risks. It takes time and effort to make nifty new apps appropriate for the enterprise, and someone has to oversee that.\nStill, Google is living in the future, sort of. It has the single longest-running (and one of the largest) deployments of Google Apps. It talks the talk and walks the walk of ringing consumer-grade tools to the enterprise. Google is not just eing nice; it elieves that empowering people makes them more productive.\nSo, how much does Google, as an enterprise, really trust the cloud?',

                "Paragraph" : "DMA channels are used y high speed devices and they allow them to communicate directly with the main memory (RAM) on our system. When DMA channels are used, CPU is not involved in the communication. Communication without the CPU is a enefit since CPU is usy with all sorts of different processing tasks. Sometimes we don't want to wait the CPU, so we enale other devices on the system to access RAM directly. DMA channels can e used y sound cards, hard disk drives, CD/DVD-ROM drives, tape drives, etc.  \n\nDMA is managed y DMA controller chip (8237). The DMA controller has four wires which are connected to certain devices on the system. On the other end, the DMA chip is connected to the Memory Controller Chip (MMC) that allows access to RAM. That way, devices that are connected to the DMA chip are ale to read and write data to RAM trough the DMA chip, without involving the CPU.\n\nSimilar to IRQs, we actually use two cascaded DMA controllers. Each chip has 4 DMA channels. Since chips are cascaded, we actually get 7 working DMA channels. One wire on the first controller is used to connect to the second DMA controller. Channel 0 (zero) is used to do just that, so it can't e used to connect other devices. Actually, channels 0 (on the first DMA chip), and 4 (on the second DMA chip) are actually the same channel.\n\nSimplified DMA Scheme\n\nSimplified DMA Scheme\n\nBy default, only one DMA channel can e assigned to one device on the system. If devices share the same DMA channel, memory errors can occur. For example, Floppy disk controller is assigned to DMA channel 2. Channel 1 is assigned to sound card. Channels 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are usually availale to e assigned y other devices on the system. Since DMA channel 0 is used to cascade two DMA chips, it is not assigned to devices.\n\nThere is also a newer type of DMA called Ultra DMA, or sometimes called Bus Mastering. This new type of DMA allows devices to ypass DMA controller all together. This way devices can access system us directly. Ultra DMA supports urst mode data transfer rates, which provides twice the speed of standard DMA performance. This is usually implemented on hard disks. Ultra ATA hard disks use ultra DMA.",

These controversial case studies show how lame shifts, myths are spread and cultural insensitivities can inflame deate.\n\nGM crops have red superweeds: True\nJay Holder, a farming consultant in Ashurn, Georgia, first noticed Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) in a client\xe2\x80\x99s transgenic cotton fields aout five years ago. Palmer amaranth is a particular pain for farmers in the southeastern United States, where it outcompetes cotton for moisture, light and soil nutrients and can quickly take over fields.\n\nFree podcast\nCase studies reveal the complex truths ehind GM crop myths.\n00:00\nGo to full podcast\nSince the late 1990s, US farmers had widely adopted GM cotton engineered to tolerate the hericide glyphosate, which is marketed as Roundup y Monsanto in St Louis, Missouri. The hericide\xe2\x80\x93crop comination worked spectacularly well \xe2\x80\x94 until it didn\xe2\x80\x99t. In 2004, hericide-resistant amaranth was found in one county in Georgia; y 2011, it had spread to 76. \xe2\x80\x9cIt got to the point where some farmers were losing half their cotton fields to the weed,\xe2\x80\x9d says Holder.\n\nSome scientists and anti-GM groups warned that GM crops, y encouraging lieral use of glyphosate, were spurring the evolution of hericide resistance in many weeds. Twenty-four glyphosate-resistant weed species have een identified since Roundup-tolerant crops were introduced in 1996. But hericide resistance is a prolem for farmers regardless of whether they plant GM crops. Some 64 weed species are resistant to the hericide atrazine, for example, and no crops have een genetically modified to withstand it (see \xe2\x80\x98The rise of superweeds\xe2\x80\x99).\n\nStill, glyphosate-tolerant plants could e considered victims of their own success. Farmers had historically used multiple hericides, which slowed the development of resistance. They also controlled weeds through ploughing and tilling \xe2\x80\x94 practices that deplete topsoil and release caron dioxide, ut do not encourage resistance. The GM crops allowed growers to rely almost entirely on glyphosate, which is less toxic than many other chemicals and kills a road range of weeds without ploughing. Farmers planted them year after year without rotating crop types or varying chemicals to deter resistance.\n\n\n\nSource: Ian Heap, International Survey of Hericide Resistant Weeds www.weedscience.org/graphs/soagraph.aspx (2013).\nExpand\n',
