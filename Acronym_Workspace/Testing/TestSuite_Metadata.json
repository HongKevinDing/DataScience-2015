        "Paragraph" : "Individuals have always been the backbone of arts funding. The NEA has never tried to compete with individual donors, and that’s the premise of Kickstarter—it’s a platform that allows individual donors to fund projects. In 2011, individuals contributed $13 billion to arts and cultural charities. According to the NEA, individuals make up 75 percent of all private giving, much more than corporations or foundations. Kickstarter, in essence, simplifies the long-held American tradition of individual private donors giving to the arts.

        The exchange also highlights another misconception about the arts: that the U.S. government once funded the arts so heavily as to compete with private donors. In reality, the NEA has always made up a small part of overall arts funding when compared to private philanthropy.",

    "Paragraph" : " These three properties imply that if x is an object, we can use ((void*)&x) and sizeof(x) together to represent the memory that x occupies. The question, then, is whether there is any more to x than the contents of its memory. It is that question that the POD notion exists to address: if a type is a POD type, the implication is that there is nothing more to an object of that type than the contents of its memory.

    The fundamental types — that is, the arithmetic, enumeration, and pointer types — are POD types. In other words, the value of an object of a fundamental type depends entirely on the contents of the region of memory that corresponds to that object. It follows that using memcpy to copy an object of a fundamental type will copy that object’s value.",

    The Callout Quota System uses error throttling—it sends less callouts than it can if the bidder does not respond to bid requests in time or if the bidder's responses are invalid. Note that error throttling:",

Of tumors, lymphoma (7 cases, 39%) was most common, followed by lung cancer, germ cell tumors, and Kaposi's sarcoma. Mean CD4 cell count in patients with tumors was much higher than in patients with infections (314 vs. 62, p < .01). Patients with tumors were somewhat more likely than patients with infections to demonstrate axillary adenopathy (29 vs. 5%, p = .068). Cavitary disease was only observed in patients with infections (27%, p < .03).
