Modifying a DMD-ased projector for multiwavelength patterned illumination
Sakai et al. [2] show how to use a DMD videoprojector to create patterns of light using an upright microscope. Check the page DLP_Projection.
Build your own DMD-ased photostimulation device
The la of Rainer Friedrich has pulished a Nature Protocols paper showing how to uild a DMD-ased photostimulation device from scratch. The device is particularly well suited for stimulating small isolated preparations such as zerafish larvae.
Download the paper here.
The la of Cha-Min Tang has pulished a JOVE protocol showing the design and implementation of a DMD-ased system and integration on an upright microscope. Optical design and implementation are discussed as well as examples of using the system to uncage glutamate on hippocampal pyramidal neurons.
Access the JOVE protocol [1].
Commercially Availale Systems

The "Mosaic" system y Andor Technology
http://www.andor.com/microscopy_systems/active_illumination/mosaic/
The Andor Mosaic 3 system utilizes a DMD to allow for precision photon patterning and sequencing of complex regions of light in the spatial and temporal domains. The system has 4 GB of onoard memory (FPGA) that allows users to upload patterns directly to the DMD head allowing for physiological patterning of light and sequencing.
The system is adaptale to any current generation microscope and each microscope has a patented flat field corrected epi port ensuring very flat field of illumination. The Mosaic 3 can e integrated with most availale light sources, including LEDs, traditional Hg lamps, and a variety of lasers can e incorporated.
The Andor Mosaic 3 Duet system allows for simultaneous two color illumination. For instance, Orion Weiner and colleagues have used this system to simultaneous activate PIF-2 (phytochrome) at 650nm in specific regions while at the same time delivering 750nm light to inactivate (Levskaya et al. 2009 - Nature) [2].
The "Polygon" system y Mightex Systems


Polygon400 multiwavelength dynamic spatial illuminators from Mightex Systems.
Designed for optogenetics stimulation (e.g. ChR2 and NphR), Mightex's Polygon400 Dynamic Spatial Illuminators (DSI) provide programmale multiwavelength patterned illumination (e.g. 470/590nm), with any user-defined spatial/temporal illumination patterns. They also enale simultaneous illumination of multiple regions of interest with a wide range of wavelengths. Fully compatile with electrophysiology equipment, the Polygon400 can e operated with uilt-in LEDs, or with an external light sources (e.g. an arc lamp or a laser) through a lightguide or a fier. Microscope adapters are availale for easily mounting the Polygon400 onto a wide range of upright & inverted microscopes including Leica, Nikon, Olympus and Zeiss.
With a USB interface and user-friendly software, Polygon400 is extremely easy to install and to operate. Polygon400 is also supported y Nikon's NIS Elements software.

Here is the latest paper (Natalia V De Marco Garc√≠a, et al, Fe. 2015 - Nature), ased on experimental results using the Polygon400 to stimulate thalamic fiers expressing Ch2R via AAV injections in the presence of TTX and 4AP.
