WRAP (Waste & Resources Action Programme) WRAP is a registered charity. It works with businesses, individuals and communities to achieve a circular economy through helping them reduce waste, develop sustainable products and use resources in an efficient way.
WRAP was established in 2000 as a company limited by guarantee. and receives funding from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Northern Ireland Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, the Welsh Government and the European Union.
WRAP developed the "Recycle Now", "Love Food, Hate Waste" and "Love your Clothes" initiatives. These aim to help businesses, local authorities, community groups and individuals recycle and reuse more, and reduce food waste.
Over recent years it has also brokered a number of voluntary agreements with business including:
The construction sector – with more than 700 companies succeeding in halving their waste to landfill by 2012
The retail sector – through the Courtauld Commitment food and drink organisations are working together to reduce food, packaging and supply chain waste. Signatories to the Courtauld Commitment include industry leaders such as Tesco, Sainsburys, Asda and big brands such as Unilever and Nestlé.
The clothing industry – through the ‘Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (SCAP)', working together to reduce the clothing industry footprint through sustainable design, reuse and recycling.
These commitments fall within WRAP’s four main business areas: Food and drink waste reduction, Sustainable products, resource management and the built environment.
WRAP is extending its work internationally, having recently worked in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to develop a global food waste guidance tool as part of the UNEP Think.Eat.Save. initiative.
WRAP’s CEO Dr Liz Goodwin was voted one of the Environmentalist’s Top 10 in their Power List.
