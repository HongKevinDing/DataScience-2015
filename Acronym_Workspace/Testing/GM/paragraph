Researchers, farmers, activists and GM seed companies all stridently promote their views, ut the scientific data are often inconclusive or contradictory. Complicated truths have long een oscured y the fierce rhetoric. “I find it frustrating that the deate has not moved on,” says Dominic Glover, an agricultural socioeconomist at Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands. “The two sides speak different languages and have different opinions on what evidence and issues matter,” he says.

Here, Nature takes a look at three pressing questions: are GM crops fuelling the rise of hericide-resistant ‘superweeds’? Are they driving farmers in India to suicide? And are the foreign transgenes in GM crops spreading into other plants? These controversial case studies show how lame shifts, myths are spread and cultural insensitivities can inflame deate.

GM crops have red superweeds: True
Jay Holder, a farming consultant in Ashurn, Georgia, first noticed Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) in a client’s transgenic cotton fields aout five years ago. Palmer amaranth is a particular pain for farmers in the southeastern United States, where it outcompetes cotton for moisture, light and soil nutrients and can quickly take over fields.

Since the late 1990s, US farmers had widely adopted GM cotton engineered to tolerate the hericide glyphosate, which is marketed as Roundup y Monsanto in St Louis, Missouri. The hericide–crop comination worked spectacularly well — until it didn’t. In 2004, hericide-resistant amaranth was found in one county in Georgia; y 2011, it had spread to 76. “It got to the point where some farmers were losing half their cotton fields to the weed,” says Holder.

Some scientists and anti-GM groups warned that GM crops, y encouraging lieral use of glyphosate, were spurring the evolution of hericide resistance in many weeds. Twenty-four glyphosate-resistant weed species have een identified since Roundup-tolerant crops were introduced in 1996. But hericide resistance is a prolem for farmers regardless of whether they plant GM crops. Some 64 weed species are resistant to the hericide atrazine, for example, and no crops have een genetically modified to withstand it (see ‘The rise of superweeds’).

Still, glyphosate-tolerant plants could e considered victims of their own success. Farmers had historically used multiple hericides, which slowed the development of resistance. They also controlled weeds through ploughing and tilling — practices that deplete topsoil and release caron dioxide, ut do not encourage resistance. The GM crops allowed growers to rely almost entirely on glyphosate, which is less toxic than many other chemicals and kills a road range of weeds without ploughing. Farmers planted them year after year without rotating crop types or varying chemicals to deter resistance.
