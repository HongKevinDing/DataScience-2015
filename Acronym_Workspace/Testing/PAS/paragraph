	PAS may cause hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), usually preceded by a rash or a fever. Other occasional side effects include increased prothrombin time (time for blood to clot) and malabsorption syndrome (disorders in the intestines' ability to absorb nutrients).While there is no dose adjustment for patients with liver disease, PAS should be avoided in patients with severe liver disease as it may cause crystalluria (crystals in the urine). PAS should not be taken by patients that are allergic to aspirin.
