Continuous Media Markup Language (CMML) is to audio or video what HTML is to text. CMML is essentially a timed text codec. It allows to structure a time-continuously sampled data file by dividing it into temporal sections (so-called clips), and provides these clips with some additional information. This information is HTML-like and is essentially a textual representation of the audio or video file. CMML enables textual searches on these otherwise binary files.
CMML is appropriate for use with all Ogg media formats, to provide subtitles and timed metadata.
CMML is deprecated; Xiph.Org Foundation recommends use Kate instead.
